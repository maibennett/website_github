I am an Assistant Professor at the **IROM department (Statistics Group), McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin**, and a research affiliate at **Learning Collider** and the **Population Research Center** at UT Austin. My research interests relate to developing and improving **statistical methods for causal inference** in observational and experimental studies. I also focus on **relevant policy questions in education**, such as socioeconomic segregation and school choice.

**Some of the projects I am currently working on:**

* "How far is too far? Estimation of an Interval for Generalization of a Regression Discontinuity Design Away from the Cutoff" (Job Market Paper) [{{% fontawesome download-solid32 %}}](/files/sub/MBennett_GRD.pdf)
* "Biased Beliefs and the Dynamic Role of Information in College Choice" (*with [Claudia Allende](https://www.claudiaallendesc.com/)*) [{{% fontawesome download-solid32 %}}](https://www.magdalenabennett.com/abstracts/#chile-rct/)
* "Difference-in-Differences using Mixed-Integer Programming Matching."
