# Tracking on the Field: The NFL and Quarterbacks' Race

## Summary

Historically, the position of quarterbacks on NFL teams has been occupied by white players, relegating players from other races to different positions. An example of these disparities can be seen in the leagueâ€™s composition: Even though over 70% of players are not white, in 55 out of the 102 seasons the NFL has been active, there has not been a single starting African American quarterback (Verderame, 2022), with a total of 32 African American starting quarterbacks in total between 1968 to 2017 (Jackson, 2017). However, this tendency appears to be shifting, with a record of 10 African American quarterbacks starting in the 2020 football season (Pendleton, 2020). This research aims to study the main reasons behind the prevalence of white quarterbacks and the subsequent shift in composition in recent years.

The hypothesis for this project stems from the fact that the quarterback is usually perceived as the leader of the team and one of the most coveted positions when players are starting (K-12 education). Given that players usually come from diverse backgrounds, and many of them
attended high schools with a high proportion of African-American population, these institutions are more likely to have an African-American quarterback. What happens to these players when they make the transition to college? Do they shift positions, or are they less likely to be selected by college teams overall? The objective of this study is to uncover some of these patterns and better understand whether African-American high school quarterbacks are more likely to be tracked to other positions compared to white high school quarterbacks, considering their skills and performance, or just less likely to be drafted overall.

By using historical data from high school and college statistics for each player, we aim to untangle the contribution of skills and physical attributes from potential discrimination in tracking players to different positions. We will be using matching methods to create matched pairs of white and African American players with similar skills and characteristics in high school and compare (i) their probability of being selected to play college football, (ii) the ranking of the college football team (if selected), and (iii) whether they are tracked to a different position or not. 

Using the aforementioned methodology, we will be able to identify the contributions of skills and other characteristics to potential tracking, as well as identifying potential discrimination in professional football associated with more visible positions of leadership, such as the quarterback. We aim to contribute to the literature on racial discrimination, in this case in the particular setting of sports, and provide robust evidence of whether there is a problem or not in this regard in professional football.

## Research Assistant

A research assistant is needed to spearhead the data collection portion of this project and participate in the data analysis. There is some centralized data availability for high school statistics, but a large portion of it will have to be scraped. 

Expected skills and characteristics:

- Knowledge in R is required (beyond basic level).
- Ability to troubleshoot independently.
- Proactivity and attention to detail.
- Some web-scraping skills (either R or Python), or ability to learn fast.
- Contextual knowledge about NFL functioning. Interest in the topic is considered a plus.

The position would be 10 hrs/week for Spring 2023, and depending on the workload, assistance with other projects may be required.
