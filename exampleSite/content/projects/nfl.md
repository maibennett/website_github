# Tracking on the Field: Racial Diversity and Disparity in Football Quarterbacking

## Summary

Historically, the position of quarterbacks on NFL teams has been occupied by white players, relegating players from other races to different positions. An example of these disparities can be seen in the leagueâ€™s composition: Even though over 70% of players are not white, in 55 out of the 102 seasons the NFL has been active, there has not been a single starting African American quarterback (Verderame, 2022), with a total of 32 African American starting quarterbacks in total between 1968 to 2017 (Jackson, 2017). However, this tendency appears to be shifting, with a record of 10 African American quarterbacks starting in the 2020 football season (Pendleton, 2020). This research aims to study the main reasons behind the prevalence of white quarterbacks and the subsequent shift in composition in recent years.

The hypothesis for this project stems from the fact that the quarterback is usually perceived as the leader of the team and one of the most coveted positions when players are starting in this sport (K-12 education). Given that players usually come from diverse backgrounds, and many of them attended high schools with a high proportion of African-American population, these institutions are more likely to have an African-American quarterback. What happens to these players when they make the transition to college? Do they shift positions, or are they less likely to be selected by college teams overall? The objective of this study is to uncover some of these patterns and better understand whether African-American high school quarterbacks are more likely to be tracked to other positions compared to white high school quarterbacks, considering their skills and performance, or just less likely to be drafted overall.

By using historical data from high school and college statistics for each player, we aim to untangle the contribution of skills and physical attributes from potential discrimination in tracking players to different positions. We will be comparing white and African American players with similar skills and characteristics in high school and compare (i) their probability of being selected to play college football, (ii) the ranking of the college football team (if selected), and (iii) whether they are tracked to a different position or not. We will also analyze their later performance in their transition from college to, potentially, the NFL.

## Research Assistant

We are looking for a short-term research assistant (1 to 2 months max.) to contribute with data collection and analysis. Some of the tasks expected to be completed are the following:

1) Expand data collection efforts for the existing data (especially with race categorization).

2) Harmonization of existing data (e.g. merging high school with college data, and college with NFL data).

3) Data visualization tasks for existing data.

4) Data description and analysis to tackle the main objective. 


A successful research assistant would be expected to have the following set of skills and characteristics:

- Knowledge in R is required (from intermediate to advance level). *Ability to pick up code quickly is also highly desirable*.
- Ability to troubleshoot independently.
- Proactivity and attention to detail.
- Contextual knowledge about football and NFL functioning. Interest in the topic is considered a plus.

The position would be 10-15 hrs/week (paid), depending on availability, and the ideal starting data would be Dec 12th (flexible depending on availability). *There would be a 1.5-2 wk break for the holidays*.
