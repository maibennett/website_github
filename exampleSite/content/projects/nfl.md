# NFL and Quaterback's Race: Tracking on the Field

## Summary

Historically, the position of quarterbacks on NFL teams has been occupied by white players, relegating players from other races to different positions. An example of these disparities can be seen in the league's composition: Even though over 70% of players are not white, between 1986 and 2017, only 32 African-American quarterbacks were starting players in the league (Jackson, 2017). However, this tendency appears to be shifting, with a record of 10 African American quarterbacks starting in the 2020 football season (Pendleton, 2020). This research aims to study the main reasons behind the prevalence of white quarterbacks and the subsequent shift in composition in recent years. By using historical data from high school and college statistics for each player, we aim to untangle the contribution of skills and physical attributes from potential discrimination in tracking players.

The hypothesis for this project stems from the fact that the quarterback is usually perceived as the leader of the team and one of the most coveted positions when players are starting (K-12 education). Given that players usually come from diverse backgrounds, and many of them attended high schools with a high proportion of African-American population, these institutions are more likely to have an African-American quarterback. What happens to these players when they make the transition to college? Do they shift positions or are less likely to be selected by college teams overall? The objective of this study is to uncover some of these patterns and better understand whether African-American high school quarterbacks are more likely to be tracked to other positions compared to white high school quarterbacks, considering their skills and performance.
